## Python: Pseudocode for Basic Calculator Project
---
### Getting Started
- Start by creating NEW project folder on your workstation desktop
- Use VS Code to save your work (temporarily) to your workstation folder
  
- Create a GitHub repo named: **basic-calculator-starter**
    - Upload your project files to the repo
    - **No need to share your repo with your teacher**
    - Teacher will discuss your work with you **during Teacher Time**
---

### Writing Your Project Pseudocode

- Discuss with your team the basic calculator project your teacher showed you
  - What Python ingredients, so to speak, would you need to make such a project?
- After your team has decided what ingredients might be part of a basic calculator, discuss and write -- **as a team** -- the pseudocode for the basic calculator your teacher demonstrated
- Write your team's pseudocode in the next section of this markdown file
- Post the link (URL) to this markdown (.md) file on Google Classroom as directed by your teacher

### Team Pseudocode for Basic Calculator

#### Team Members: (Alex and Josh)

- Step 1
Write down a message using the print function that says that this is a basic calculator and how your calculator is used
- Step 2
Then use the print function to add 2 blank spaces between your messages
- Step 3
Use the print function again to demonstrate the four types of math that can be used and what number they're assigned to
- Step 4
Make some variables (about 3) and use the input funtion so that the user can put in the choice for their type of math they want to use (using numbers 1-4) and the other two variables should be used to get the two numbers the user wants to use
- Step 5 
Use the if-elif-else statement to have it so depending on what type of math the user has choosen it will properly register that and do the equation. Also add at the end that if the user has not a given a proper number that the number is invalid and that they should enter another number
